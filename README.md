# rpg-minigames
A collection of minigames for your RPG adventures!

## Purpose
In this repo I want to make a collection of various minigames suitable for any tabletop RPG game in order to enrich it with more chanllenges and mechanincs.

## Types
There will be a bunch of different minigame tipes:

    # dice only minigames: these minigames can be played with your dice and won't require specific resources or tools.
    # puzzle minigames: these minigames can be solved direclty on your computer or printed and solved with pen & paper.
    # map minigames: these minigames will generate a map and it's better if you print it (A3 format is the most suited) and place it on your table for everyone to see. If you have miniatures cells should be large enough to fit an average miniature on them.
    # misc minigames: these minigames will feature different formats (tables, print and cut etc.) and the required tools will be listed in the minigame description.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
