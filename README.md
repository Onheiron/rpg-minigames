# rpg-minigames
A collection of minigames for your RPG adventures!

## Purpose
In this repo I want to make a collection of various minigames suitable for any tabletop RPG game in order to enrich it with more chanllenges and mechanincs.

## Minigames Index
Here a list of available minigames.

### Dice Only
These minigames can be played with your dice and won't require specific resources or tools.

#### Fishing
Fishing is a relaxing activity based on patience and swiftness.
In order to represent this with dice, we need some mechanics that comprehends an "idle" part (patience) and a "evaluation" part (swiftness).
To do so, we could set a threshold and play something like a blackjack game against that threshold: the fishing player keeps rolling the die until the sum of all the rolls "bust" the threshold or the player feels the risk of busting is too high and decides to reel the rod in.

#### Looking for herbs and shrooms
#### Brewing potions
#### Bargain prices

### Puzzle
These minigames can be solved direclty on your computer or printed and solved with pen & paper.

### Map
These minigames will generate a map and it's better if you print it (A3 format is the most suited) and place it on your table for everyone to see. If you have miniatures cells should be large enough to fit an average miniature on them.

### Misc
These minigames will feature different formats (tables, print and cut etc.) and the required tools will be listed in the minigame description.
